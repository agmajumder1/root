    <description>Purpose: Portal Role Name is derived based on the Account Name. Since Partner account names can be unpredictably long, there can be a  loss of data when an Account is converted to a portal account.
To ensure that we share the Cases with the right roles, we capture the lowest and the highest roles of each partner ID. 

Ex : If VOX is a PartnerId__c of VOX accountName and the roles created as a result of creating a portal user are VOXCustomerManager and VOXCustomer User, then we capture the triplet, (VOX,VOXCustomer User,VOXCustomerManager) as one custom setting record.

This benefits the scenario where the Account Names are so lengthy that Salesforce would truncate a part of it, thus making it difficult to determine the name of the role at run time. 

If there are X Service Providers + Distributors and the community has two roles, then there must be X records in this objects.

This is of at most importance for the security model of Case to work properly.</description>
